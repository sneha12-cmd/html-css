Forests are rightly called as the lungs of the earth. They are the most important part of our ecosystem and are pivotal in maintaining 
the balance in the food cycle and the natural equilibrium on the planet.Forests cover almost 31% of the surface of the earth. 
They are a habitat for not only wildlife and trees but also to some of the rarest of rare animals and plants on earth.
Man has been using the resources of forests for thousands of years. As much as the forest has provided man with his livelihood,
man has not given back to the forest as much as he should have. And this overuse, imbalance and greed of man have led to a disturbance in 
the natural cycle of the earth.Forests are the lifeline of the existence of the earth. Without forest cover on this planet, devastating and 
cascading effects on the life cycle and climate change can be seen with a negative impact on human life.
Forests are made up on trees, shrubs, grasses, herbs and much more. They are home to millions of animal species and birds. Forests are also 
a blessing for mankind as it provides many resources that human beings can use in order to survive and prosper.
forests provide resources like wood, nutrients, rare timber, food, fuel and much more to human beings for their survival. Early humans were 
solely dependant on the forest for food and fuel to eat and survive.But as man evolved and his mental horizon expanded, he started taking 
advantage of various other resources that forests provided us with, including cutting down forest land for agriculture purposes, killing 
animals for furs, horns and organs, and conducting deforestation drives to expand cities and villages.
